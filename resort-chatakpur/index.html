          <h2 style="font-size:24px;margin:0 0 20px 0;font-family:arial;">Our best Resort in Chatakpur</h2>
          <p style="font-size:14px;">Chatakpur is a beautiful village north of bengali. The village of Chatakpur is located at an altitude of 7887 meters in a hill town in the Darjeeling region. It is located 7 km from sonada in the middle of the senchal reserve forest, in Chatakpur popular among tourists as it offers a panaromic view of snow-capped mountains, the himalayan range and a lush green alpine forest.On a clear day visitors can enjoy the divine view of the sunrise and Mt.Kanchenjunga from the Chatakpur viewing area. We were both lucky to witness. As we visit the moon of January we once again experienced a snowstorm that was a miracle for us. Great time to visit Chatakpur from October to February.Cavitles and one forest door hotel are available for you to stay. Video i is available on my YT Channel TravelersLens which covers transportation, accommodation, food, cost and sightseeing. Chatakpur hilltop village is behind the Tiger Hill and one can have a almost 120 degree panoramic view of the Mt Kanchengungha, Mt. Pandim, Mt. Kumbhakarna and the adjacent ranges. The sunrise view of these snowy magnificent peaks is breathtaking. The experience is comparable to the experience of sunrise from Tiger Hills but in a more personal, less crowded environment. There is a sunrise viewpoint where you may trek to get a better and wider view but even from the basic village homestays the sight is no lesser. On one side of the hills there are huge pine trees which curve down to the steps of a pine forest region. This place is ideal for all age groups. A short vacation in a quaint quiet place for relaxing and lazing or for short treks to points permitted by the Forest Dept. Chatakpur Eco Village Hut is managed and maintained by the Forest Dept. This place has four two bedded cottages with attached bathrooms with geysers for hot water. The booking is on basis of lodging with meals per person/day. The rooms were clean and had sufficient blankets for the nights and there was running water in the bathroom taps throughout the day. The food served was yummy. But as this is a small place and far away from closest markets and grocery places, you cannot have food preparations on demand at last minute. We happily ate what we were served but I guess for a larger group of people if any specific food request is made ahead of time they will prepare it. Tiger hill, Ghoom, Darjeeling are nearby locations for a day trip from here. But I wonder why would any one visit those once you are here :) Caution - there are no shops for buying souvenirs or restaurants for munching. Though the snowy peaks of the mountain ranges can be viewed from almost every corner of the Chatakpur village but unfortunately the range is not directly visible from the Vhatakput Eco Huts as this is at a slight lower step of the village area and the northern side ilies tall pine trees but if you walk around 80/90 feet you will be able to view the ranges. Also, you cannot see the Mt Everest from this place.</p>
          <p style="font-size:14px;">Chatakpur! Located 7.5km from Sonada, this small mountain range is located in the Senchel Wildlife Sanctuary. Eco tourism huts are maintained by the forest department. The manager, Vinod Rai, is very helpful but it is best not to expect a quick service as locals take time out of their daily activities to manage eco-friendly homes. One can hear the chirping of birds and the strange sound of cattle, and nothing more. There is not much work to be done other than walking lazily around a dense jungle nearby. There is a sunrise at a distance of 1km up the hill, but unfortunately, I missed it due to cloud cover. If you like tranquility, nature and a cold climate, Chatakpur is for you! It is very cold after sunset so prepare yourself with extra layers of warm clothing. Try to avoid monsoons and winter and book in advance eco huts as early as only 4 in total. The rooms are large enough with 24 hours of hot water and enough blankets to keep you warm and comfortable. N.B .: Since this is a nature resort, people must be careful not to waste water and electricity and avoid dumping waste. It was very sad to see plastic bottles and packets filled the center, despite the many rubbish bins. It's sad to see a wildlife sanctuary full of plastic (no worse !!)</p>
<h3 style="font-size:24px;margin:0 0 20px 0;">ATTRACTIONS AROUND Chatakpur:</h3>
<p style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Tiger Hill</strong> - Tiger Hill offers beautiful panoramas of the Greater Himalayas. Kanchenjunga, the third highest peak in the world, is illuminated at sunset and at sunrise in colorful displays. Mt Everest and a few other mountain peaks of the 8000 + m club can easily be seen on this mountain. You can even see the city of Kurseong on a sunny day, the destination itself offers not only beautiful views during sunrise, a place where you can immerse yourself in the beauty of the Himalayas at any time during the day.<br/>
<strong>Senchal Lake</strong> - Senchal Lake is a beautiful water feature located in the Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary. The lake offers amazing views of the hilly environment. The lake water is clean and potable, which is why it is supplied throughout Darjeeling. Surrounded by dense forests of oak, pine and birch, this is a picture of a place where you can discover nature in a very vivid way. Colorful flowers like rhododendrons and orchids on the lake shore enhance the beauty.<br/>
<strong>Senchal Wildlife Sanctury</strong> - The dense canopy of the Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary is home to a wide variety of wildlife and birds. In fact you may be surprised to see birds such as the Himalayan Bulbul, Blue magpie, warbler and Verdant Flycatcher often appear. As for the wildlife, if you are lucky enough, you can watch the Great Himalayan Black Bear, the mountain leopard and the barking deer.<br/>
<strong>Runglee Rungliot Tea Estate</strong> - Among the most popular Tea sites in the Darjeeling region, Runglee Rungliot is one of them. It is actually one of the oldest Duncans tea varieties. One can visit the estate factories and watch tea processing but not winter as it is usually closed in winter. A beautiful view from the tea garden will surely delight the person. You can explore the area by walking through the tea gardens and interacting with local people.</p>
