<h3 style="font-size:24px;margin:0 0 20px 0;">Sightseeing from Sillery Gaon</h3><p> 

Ramitea Viewpoint:<br/>

The breathtaking longest view of River Teesta along with its 14 bends through the valleys is incomparable and amazing. Another view that you can enjoy from the Ramitey viewpoint is the confluence of the Teesta and Reshi rivers. If the sky is clear, you can also enjoy a stunning view of the entire region from Teesta Bazar to Majhitar in Sikkim. Ramitey View Point is just 3 km from Sillery Gaon.<br/><br/>

Cross Hill:<br/> Located on a lookout, it is also a sunset lookout. The view of Mount Kanchenjunga and other areas from this place is stunning. You can also have a clear view of the Tibet Autonomous Region from here. Cross Hill is highly revered as a place of pilgrimage for the local Christian community, as history says, in the 19th century, some evangelists began traveling to Tibet to spread Christianity. They never returned and the cross was erected in the hope that they would see the cross and know where to return.<br/><br/>


Hanuman Top:<br/>Once you reach Damsang Fort, you should not miss the small hike to Hanuman Top. Here you will find a Nice Statue of Lord Hanuman. The pristine beauty and serenity of this place is in itself unmatched. It also offers an excellent bird's eye view of Kalimpong town and the surrounding areas.<br/><br/>


Silent Valley: <br/>A vast wide green pasture, surrounded by tall pine trees and the only silence interrupted by the chirping of birds creates a place with a magical atmosphere. The downward trek through the misty forest and the sudden appearance of a green meadow will captivate you. The Silent Valley becomes a small body of water during the rainy season, once upon a time it was originally a lake.<br/><br/>


Damsang Fort :<br/> You can reach this almost ruined fortress after an hour's walk through the pine forest. It is about 4 km from Sillery Gaon. It is also considered an ideal place for bird watching. The road to this place through the lush green forest offers a wonderful view of the surrounding hills and valleys. This fort was built in 1690 by the Lepcha Kingdom, but very few ruins remain today.<br/><br/>
